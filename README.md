## Heap-Sort Algorithm

### *Algorithm Description*
   Heap-Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the properties of a binary heap (max-heap or min-heap).<br>
   It efficiently sorts data in O(nlogn) time and is an in-place sorting algorithm, requiring no extra memory for intermediate operations.
   
### *Steps Involved in Heap-Sort*
 1. Build a Max Heap: <br>
         Traverse all non-leaf nodes and ensure the max heap property for each node using a process called heapify.
 2. Sort the Array
      1. Swap the root with the last element in the heap and then heapify the reduced heap.
      2. Repeat until all elements are sorted.
### *Time Complexity Analysis*
1. Time Complexity:
      - Building the heap: O(n)
      - Sorting the heap: O(nlogn)
      - Total: O(nlogn)
2. Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).

   - 2nd extraction: [4, 1, 3, 5, 10]
   - 3rd extraction: [3, 1, 4, 5, 10]
   - 4th extraction: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]

## Kruskal's Algorithm

### *Algorithm Description*

Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)<br> of a connected, weighted graph. The MST is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices<br> in the graph while minimizing the total edge weight and avoiding any cycles.
#### Key Idea:
1. Sort all edges by weight (in ascending order).
2. Add edges one by one to the MST, ensuring no cycles are formed.
3. Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently detect cycles.

### *Steps Involved in Kruskal Algorithm*

1. Input Preparation:
- Accept the graph in the form of edges with weights.
- Sort edges in ascending order of their weights.
2.Initialize the Disjoint Set:
- Each vertex is its own parent initially (for cycle detection).
3. Edge Selection:
- Iterate through the sorted edges.
- For each edge, check if it connects two different sets of vertices using DSU.
- If yes, add the edge to the MST and merge the two sets.
4. Stop Condition:
- Stop adding edges when the MST contains V‚àí1 edges, where V is the number of vertices.

### *Time Complexity Analysis*
1. Sorting Edges: O(ElogE), where E is the number of edges.
2. Union-Find Operations:
- Each find or union operation takes ùëÇ(Œ±(V)), where ùõº is the inverse Ackermann function (almost constant for practical inputs).
- Performed E times, so the total is O(E‚ãÖŒ±(V)).

  
Overall Time Complexity: O(ElogE+E‚ãÖŒ±(V))‚âàO(ElogE) for most cases.
Space Complexity: O(V+E), primarily for storing edges and the DSU structure.

2.Initialize DSU(Disjoint Set Union): Each vertex is its own parent.
3. Iterate Through Edges:
- Add edge (1, 2, 5) ‚Üí No cycle ‚Üí MST = [(1, 2, 5)].
- Add edge (3, 4, 5) ‚Üí No cycle ‚Üí MST = [(1, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5)].
- Add edge (0, 1, 7) ‚Üí No cycle ‚Üí MST = [(1, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5), (0, 1, 7)].
- Add edge (1, 4, 7) ‚Üí No cycle ‚Üí MST = [(1, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5), (0, 1, 7), (1, 4, 7)].
- Stop (MST now contains V‚àí1=4 edges).
